(Semi-) automatically generated docker CLI aliases.

Heavily inspired by [oh-my-zsh git plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/git/README.md) 
and [kubectl-aliases](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases).

## Installation

```bash
# Create aliases with docker
docker run --rm schnatterer/docker-aliases > ~/.docker_aliases && source ~/.docker_aliases
# Alternative: Create aliases with local node and docker installation, executing script from this repo
node createAliases.js | cat > ~/.docker_aliases && source ~/.docker_aliases
# Load aliases when zsh starts
echo "[[ -f ~/.docker_aliases ]] && source ~/.docker_aliases" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Note that in the container the `Docker Inc,` sub commands `docker app` and `docker buildx` seem not to be included when
run within docker container. 

## Learning aliases

Pro tip: grep the `alias` command, e.g like so:  

```bash
alias | grep 'docker run'
```

### Parameters in aliases

Are implemented by the following rules

* At max 3 parameters within one alias 
* At max one non-boolean parameter per alias (must be at the end because of argument)
* Parameters without single character abbreviation (starting in `--`, e.g. `--rm`) are only contained in alias if 
  * the parameter has less than three chars
  * has a predefined abbreviation (e.g. `entrypoint` = `ep`)
  * contains a hyphen (is then abbreviated `<first char><first char after hyphen`, e.g. `--log-level` = `ll`) (coming soon)
* Order of parameters in alias
  * Parameters without single character abbreviation go first,
  * followed by the single character parameters (e.g. `-t`),
  * The boolean parameter is always at the end  
    (otherwise the the command would not be syntactically correct).
  * If multiple Parameters without single character abbreviation or single char params the order is always alphabetical,  
    i.e  params `a`, `b` and `c` -> `ab`, `ac`, `abc`, `bc`. Not `ba`, `ca`, etc.  
    Otherwise there would be way to many aliases.

### Prominent examples

```bash
dpsa # docker ps -a
drit image # docker run -it image
drrmd image # docker run --rm -d image'
drrmit image sh # docker run --rm -it image sh
drrmitep sh image # docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh image '
drrmep id image # docker run --rm --entrypoint id image '
dexit container sh # docker exec -it container sh
```

## Aliases missing?

* Could be because of conflicts, see TODOs at the end
* Contributions welcome, create an issue or PR.

## Contribute

Contributions welcome!

* Are there aliases missing you use often?
* What are your most used abbrevs? Is one of them missing in the aliases?
  Ask your shell history:

```bash
# Most frequent docker commands
history| grep -E '^ *[0-9\w]*  docker ' | awk '{d = ""; for (f=2; f<=NF; ++f) {if ($f =="|") break; printf("%s%s", d, $f); d = OFS}; printf("\n") }' |sort|uniq -c|sort -rn | grep '\-' | less
# Most frequent sub commands: 
history| grep -E '^ *[0-9\w]*  docker ' | awk '{print $2" "$3}' |awk 'BEGIN {FS="|"} {print $1}'|sort|uniq -c|sort -rn|head -30
``` 

## Implementation Details

The algorithm tries to create the shortest possible alias without conflicting with other commands. As it does not favor 
commands (how should it decide?) the resulting abbreviations are sometimes longer thant necessary (e.g. `image` vs 
`Ã¬mages` results in `images` and `images`), so with some manual intervention we decide that they can be shorter.
Some commands that are used very often are manually privileged to get shorter abbreviations than others.
Very much opinionated.

### SubCommands and parameters

Parsing sub commands and creating aliases is fairly simple and results in about 200 aliases.
There already are a couple of conflicts like `di` for `docker` `import`, `image` and `docker images` that are resolved 
by the algorithm and/or predefined abbreviations.

Adding parameters per sub command is surprisingly complex, though:

* How to automatically generate useful abbreviations for longer params such as `docker --tlsverify`?
* And the worst: For which combination of parameters to create aliases?   
  * `docker run` alone has already almost 100 params - if we created aliases of for permutations of 100 params, that would be 10^157 aliases ðŸ˜±
  * Let alone the potential conflicts that arise when combining the alias of one sub command with 100 param characters.
  * And who can remember an alias of 100 characters anyway?

So for now the pragmatic solution is as follows:
* Use only params that have a single char abbreviation
* Don't create all permutations of all params of each sub command, but only in alphabetical order,   
  e.g. params `a`, `b` and `c` -> `ab`, `ac`, `abc`, `bc`. Not `ba`, `ca`, etc.
* Create only aliases containing at max 3 params.  
* In addition, some parameters are defined manually that also can be longer.
* Conflicts are not resolved. Sub commands take precedence, param abbreviations conflicting with sub commands are ignored.  
  Interestingly, there are only 5 conflicts (see stderr output)

Here are some numbers (docker `19.03.4-rc1`):
* Only sub commands (no params) - 200 aliases (commit 2f844fc6)
* sub commands and at max one boolean param per alias - 500 aliases (commit 8cd17435)
* sub commands and at max two boolean param per alias (not all permutations but alphabetical) - 1000 aliases (8cd17435)

### Error handling and logging

As the result is printed on stdout, all technical output is printed on stderr. That is, info and errors. 
Don't try this at home ðŸ˜¬.

### Why node.js?

Dynamic typing allows for easy change of data structures. As this was implemented more exploratory as a kind of POC, the
data structures were changed quite often. See git history

### Why no unit tests (yet)

Also here: The exploratory / POC nature of development would have caused a lot of unit tests to be thrown away.
Therefore a "golden master" testing approach was more effective here:  
Create aliases, implement change, diff with previous aliases.
Once the implemented approach is proven, a lot of refactoring should be done. This time using TDD, validating against 
the golden master.

### Potential new features / ideas / TODOs

* How to properly handle parameter conflicts? 
  * For short params there is no conflict resolution.
  * In conflicts with subcommands the params could take precedence. But make all maybe 100 aliases of a subcommand longer 
    because of one param alias?  
* provide CLI option for overriding (e.g. for podman) and use throughout app
* predefinedAbbrevCmds - use the same abbrevs also in nested commands, i.e. svc for docker services and docker stack services
